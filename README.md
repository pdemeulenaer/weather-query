# Weather-query
Python project to query open weather api. First objective is to develop snippets to call several freely available weather forecast api's (see https://rapidapi.com/blog/access-global-weather-data-with-these-weather-apis/)

## Objectives

* Query weather data of different cities/places. Compare the 5-days forecasts done in the past with real data to derive performance for each weather api tested, for different quantities (temperature, wind speed, ...)


## Todo

* Create a class for the cities. 
    * Create method that converts city to position (lon, lat)
* Create a docker image for the application.
